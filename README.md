### 💼 About Me

I am a dedicated and motivated Software Engineering graduate with a BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering from CINEC Campus. I am currently working at the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) as an Intern – Industry Development Pillar, where I have gained valuable exposure to multiple phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). My experience includes feasibility studies, requirement engineering, SRS documentation, architectural diagram design, UI design using Figma, version control with GitHub, project documentation handling, and project procurement processes. I have also actively worked in projects following the Agile Scrum methodology, strengthening my ability to collaborate and adapt in dynamic environments. Previously, I interned as a Software Developer (WordPress) at BenWorldwide.

I have a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java and a solid understanding of PHP, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, I am familiar with tools and frameworks such as React.js, Next.js, Android Studio, WordPress frameworks, GitHub, Figma, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and other development tools.

As a fast and adaptive learner, I excel at understanding concepts from their core basics and applying them effectively. I am passionate about continuous learning, software engineering, and leveraging technology to create impactful solutions that support both industry and community growth.
